# Gilded Rose refactoring kata

My second attempt at the Gilded Rose kata, this time in JavaScript.

Original legacy code from
[Emily Bache](git@github.com:emmavanoss/gilded-rose-js.git)

## Setup

* run `npm install` to install dependencies
* to run tests: `npm test`
* to run eslint: `npm run lint` (follows Airbnb style)
